NAME
     cat -- concatenate and print files

SYNOPSIS
     cat [-benstuv] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.
     The file operands are processed in command-line order.  If file is a single dash
     (`-') or absent, cat reads from the standard input.  If file is a UNIX domain
     socket, cat connects to it and then reads it until EOF.  This complements the
     UNIX domain binding capability available in inetd(8).

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.

     -e      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display a dol-
             lar sign (`$') at the end of each line.

     -n      Number the output lines, starting at 1.

     -s      Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be single
             spaced.

     -t      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display tab
             characters as `^I'.

     -u      Disable output buffering.
